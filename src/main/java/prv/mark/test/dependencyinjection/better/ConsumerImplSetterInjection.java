/**
 * THIS APPLICATION EXAMPLE IS SETTER-LEVEL DI
 *
 * http://www.journaldev.com/2394/java-dependency-injection-design-pattern-example-tutorial
 *
 * Java Dependency Injection design pattern allows us to remove the hard-coded dependencies and make our application loosely
 * coupled, extendable and maintainable. We can implement dependency injection in java to move the dependency resolution from
 * compile-time to runtime.
 *
 * Dependency Injection in java requires at least following:
 *
 * 1. Service components should be designed with base class or interface. Itâ€™s better to prefer interfaces or
 *    abstract classes that would define contract for the services.
 * 2. Consumer classes should be written in terms of service interface.
 * 3. Injector classes that will initialize the services and then the consumer classes.
 *
 * BENEFITS of Java Dependency Injection
 *
 * Some of the benefits of using Dependency Injection in Java are:
 *
 * 1. Separation of Concerns
 * 2. Boilerplate Code reduction in application classes because all work to initialize dependencies is
 *    handled by the injector component
 * 3. Configurable components makes application easily extendable
 * 4. Unit testing is easy with mock objects
 *
 * Disadvantages of Java Dependency Injection
 *
 * 1. If overused, it can lead to maintenance issues because effect of changes are known at runtime.
 * 2. Dependency injection in java hides the service class dependencies that can lead to runtime errors
 *    that would have been caught at compile time.

     We have used constructors to inject the dependencies in the application classes, another way is
     to use setter method to inject dependencies in application classes. For setter method dependency
