/**
 * http://www.journaldev.com/2394/java-dependency-injection-design-pattern-example-tutorial
 *
 * Dependency Injection in java requires at least following:
 *
 * 1. Service components should be designed with base class or interface. Itâ€™s better to prefer interfaces or
 *    abstract classes that would define contract for the services.
 * 2. Consumer classes should be written in terms of service interface.
 * 3. Injector classes that will initialize the services and then the consumer classes.
 *
 * BENEFITS of Java Dependency Injection
 *
 * Some of the benefits of using Dependency Injection in Java are:
 *
 * 1. Separation of Concerns
 * 2. Boilerplate Code reduction in application classes because all work to initialize dependencies is
 *    handled by the injector component
 * 3. Configurable components makes application easily extendable
 * 4. Unit testing is easy with mock objects
 *
 * Disadvantages of Java Dependency Injection
 *
 * 1. If overused, it can lead to maintenance issues because effect of changes are known at runtime.
 * 2. Dependency injection in java hides the service class dependencies that can lead to runtime errors
 *    that would have been caught at compile time.
